# POTA Activation Map

This is the source code for an [interactive map](https://lasandell.github.io/pota/)
of my [Parks on the Air](https://parksontheair.com/index.html) activations.
It uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to plot contacts on an OpenStreetMap
map. A separate, unpublished tool is used to extract the data from my ADIF logs
and generate the corresponding JSON files backing the map.
